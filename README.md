# High-Performance DoH Proxy Worker

A Cloudflare Worker that proxies DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) requests with enhanced performance, reliability, and features.

## Description

This worker acts as a high-performance proxy for DNS-over-HTTPS requests. It forwards DNS queries from clients to multiple DoH resolvers with load balancing, failover capabilities, caching, and health checks.

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Multi-Provider Support**: Supports Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, OpenDNS, AdGuard, ControlD, Mullvad, and NextDNS
- ‚úÖ **Ad-Blocking Support**: Built-in ad, tracker, and malware blocking through specialized DNS providers
- ‚úÖ **Load Balancing**: Intelligent weighted distribution of requests across providers
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Failover**: Seamless switching to backup providers when primary ones fail

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. (Optional) Modify provider list in `workers.js`:
   ```javascript
   const DOH_PROVIDERS = [
     // Add or modify providers here
   ];
   ```

## Deployment

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Deploy with Wrangler CLI

For more control over deployment, you can use Wrangler CLI directly:

1. Install Wrangler globally (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   ```

2. Authenticate with your Cloudflare account:
   ```bash
   wrangler login
   ```

3. Deploy to development environment:
   ```bash
   wrangler deploy --env dev
   ```

4. Deploy to production environment:
   ```bash
   wrangler deploy --env production
   ```

5. View your deployed worker:
   ```bash
   wrangler deployments list
   ```

Additional Wrangler commands:
- `wrangler dev` - Start a local development server
- `wrangler tail` - View real-time logs from your deployed worker
- `wrangler secret put <key>` - Add secrets to your worker
- `wrangler delete` - Remove your worker from Cloudflare

## Usage

After deployment, you can use this worker as a DoH endpoint:

### GET Requests
```bash
https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/dns-query?dns=<base64url-encoded-dns-query>
```

**Why base64url encoding?** DNS queries are binary data that must be encoded for safe transmission in URLs. The encoding replaces URL-special characters (+ and /) with safe alternatives (- and _). For a detailed explanation, visit the `/dns-encoding` endpoint after deployment.

### POST Requests (No Base64 Encoding Required)
For clients that prefer to avoid base64 encoding, you can send raw binary DNS queries using POST requests with `Content-Type: application/dns-message`. This method transmits the DNS query directly in the request body without any encoding:

```bash
# POST request with raw binary DNS query (no base64 encoding)
curl -H "Content-Type: application/dns-message" \
     --data-binary @query.dns \
     https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/dns-query
```

### Example with dig
```bash
# Using GET method (requires base64 encoding)
dig @your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev example.com

# Using POST method (no encoding required)
dig @your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev example.com +tcp
```

### Example with curl
```bash
# GET request with base64url-encoded DNS query
curl "https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/dns-query?dns=q80BAAABAAAAAAAAA3d3dwdleGFtcGxlA2NvbQAAAQAB"

# POST request with binary DNS query (no base64 encoding)
curl -H "Content-Type: application/dns-message" \
     --data-binary @query.dns \
     https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/dns-query
```

### Using Without Base64 Encoding
If you want to avoid base64 encoding entirely, always use POST requests with the `Content-Type: application/dns-message` header. The DNS query should be sent as raw binary data in the request body. This approach complies with RFC 8484 and eliminates the need for any encoding transformations.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Landing page with usage instructions
- `GET /dns-encoding` - Detailed explanation of DNS query encoding
- `GET /dns-query?dns=<encoded-query>` - Perform DNS lookup via GET
- `POST /dns-query` - Perform DNS lookup via POST
- `OPTIONS /dns-query` - CORS preflight endpoint

## Response Headers

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` - Enables CORS for web applications
- `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300` - 5-minute cache for DNS responses
- `Content-Type: application/dns-message` - Standard DNS message format

## Configuration

You can customize the provider list and weights in `workers.js`:

```javascript
const DOH_PROVIDERS = [
  // General DNS providers
  {
    name: "Cloudflare",
    url: "https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query",
    weight: 20
  },
  // ... other general providers
  
  // Ad-blocking DNS providers
  {
    name: "AdGuard",
    url: "https://dns.adguard.com/dns-query",
    weight: 10
  },
  // ... other ad-blocking providers
];
```

The worker automatically distributes DNS queries across all configured providers based on their weights. Ad-blocking providers help block ads, trackers, and malicious domains at the DNS level.

## Error Handling

The worker handles various error conditions:
- Provider timeouts or failures (automatic failover)
- Invalid DNS queries (400 Bad Request)
- Unsupported HTTP methods (405 Method Not Allowed)
- All providers unavailable (503 Service Unavailable)

## Performance Tips

1. Use GET requests for simple queries (better caching)
2. Enable HTTP/2 for reduced latency
3. Consider using the worker as a resolver in your local DNS setup
4. Monitor provider performance and adjust weights accordingly
